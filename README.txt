>>>NAME:
  Covid-19 Smart Alarm System

>>>DESCRIPTION:
  This alarm system is linked to a html template and
  uses APIs from 3 different websites and extracts their corresponding
  json files with the relevant information.
  These json files are then used to display notifications in the webpage
  with information in them. Notifications are displayed on the right side
  of the webpage. We can delete notifications by pressing the x button of
  the target notification. Notifications are scheduled to be regularly
  updated using the "sched" and "time" python modules.

  In this smart alarm we can also set alarms that use the text-to-speech
  module to announce covid rates in Exeter using a json file that contains
  this information.
  Alarms can be set by entering into the label text box in the html.
  Alarms are displayed on the left side of the webpage and can be cancelled
  by pressing the x button of the alarm box.
